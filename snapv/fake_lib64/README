Here stored some fake libs if needed. 
Example: one snap is missing one lib (yes this happens rearly or need a system lib for a specific version older than your system.)
You can found lib-old_version.so* files and place them here and your system will be safe... 
This path is already included in LD_PATH for snapV. Only place libs here and thats all.
